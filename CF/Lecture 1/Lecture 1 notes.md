# Lecture 1

##  Intro

Time is important, small changes in meassuring time yields vastly different result, even unusable at some times.

## Periodic code execution

Tp = Time period
Td = Time duration


Whats good about an idling system
Pro 
	Easy to implement
	no need for real time operating
	Knowing worst case execution time you may go close to the edge
Cons
	only on time period, or more than one
	
## Same code every sample
## Goal : keep Fs
## Minimize latency
