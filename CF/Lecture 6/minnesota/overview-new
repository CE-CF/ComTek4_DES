About this Course
 
Software is quickly becoming integral part of human life as we see more and more automation and technical advancements.
Just like we expect car to work all the time and can't afford to break or reboot unexpectedly, software industry needs to continue to learn better way to build software if it were to become integral part of human life.

In this course,  you will get an overview of
  how software teams work?
  What processes they use?
  What are some of the industry standard methodologies?
  What are pros and cons of each?

You will learn enough to have meaningful conversation around software development processes.


After completing this course, a learner will be able to 

1) Apply core software engineering practices at conceptual level for a given problem. 
2) Compare and contrast traditional, agile, and lean development methodologies at high level.  These include Waterfall, Rational Unified Process, V model, Incremental, Spiral models and overview of agile mindset 
3) Propose a methodology best suited for a given situation
